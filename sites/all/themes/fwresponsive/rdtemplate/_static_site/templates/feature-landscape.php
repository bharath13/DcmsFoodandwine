              Enrique Olvera, more than any other chef, convinced the world that Mexico City is an essential pin on every global food map. Now he shares the classic places that inspire his brilliant Mexican cooking.

        <div class="feature__content divider">
          <p>Ghosts are everywhere in Mexico City, looming massively over the living. At the highest point in Bosque de Chapultepec, the city’s gracefully scrubby central park, the dead are stacked up like churros in David Alfaro Siqueiros’s 1957 mural of martyrs to the Revolution. Closer to earth, in the posh apartment zone of Polanco, chef Enrique Olvera’s dead grandfather—photographed like a silver-screen star—gazes like a specter on everyone entering or leaving the city’s most famous restaurant, Pujol.</p>
          <p>I’m in Mexico City for a ghost tour of my own: I want to find the dishes that haunt Olvera’s memory. This is the food that inspires the 39-year-old hero of modern Mexican gastronomy, both at Pujol and at his year-old New York City restaurant, Cosme. Olvera, more than any other chef, convinced the world that Mexico City is an essential pin on every global map of food. He grew up in and around here, heading to the US to study at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. In 2000, he opened Pujol—a slurring of pozole, his nickname in school, a burn for being pudgy. His food was heavily influenced by The French Laundry Cookbook: New American tweaked with Mexican ingredients, as in foie gras with guava. It wasn’t until 2005 that Olvera found his own</p>

          <p>Dinner at Pujol can invade your senses like a distillation of Mexico. You feel its sweep in a series of small, expressive gestures: the first spring escamoles (ant larvae), bursting from a single pea pod, a statement of birth. Or the contrasting moles: a two-year-old mole madre, brown as earth, perpetually fed with new mole; and a brick-red mole nuevo. Both are spread on the plate as a disk within a circle, like some reductive Aztec calendar. Olvera is a chef who thinks a lot about time. When Cosme opened, critics pored over the dishes to divine some authentic expression of Mexico. Some found it. Others focused on Olvera’s genius as a restaurateur, his charisma, the way he studies his clientele and gives them what they want in a place thousands of miles from his source of inspiration. Right now, kitty-corner from me at the massive table in the private dining room at Pujol, just off the burnished galley of a prep kitchen that’s animated by a dozen cooks, Olvera is trying to find his voice in the literal sense. After two months away, he got back to Mexico City with a raw throat ravaged by a cold. He’s sipping an infusion of ginger and lime, poured from a murky French press one of his cooks has just delivered.</p>
          <-- TK -->
          <p>Olvera looks slightly withered, though. This week while he’s in Mexico, his life is a tight grid of two-hour calendar blocks. He just wrapped his epic English-language book for Phaidon, Mexico from the Inside Out, which traces the life of Pujol. Now he has to approve the type of padded envelopes that review copies will be mailed in, go over blueprints for Manta—a restaurant at The Cape hotel in Mexico’s Los Cabos—and taste the tiny chia-seed tostada one of his sous-chefs has tracked him down to try. He also wants to take me to his laid-back café, Eno, just down the street, where the menu is stocked with breakfast and lunch standards like eggs with chorizo and quinoa salad.</p>
          <p>But this morning, Olvera is most interested in taking me around Mexico City to try the classic dishes he loves best. He says, “A lot of people in Mexico are like, ‘Oh, now that you’re in New York you don’t give a shit about us anymore.’ That’s wrong: Pujol is the first, the most important restaurant.” At Pujol, Olvera’s inspiration drips through a filter of thought and technique, but in New York City he traces a more direct line to the foods he loves, some since he was a kid. Cosme is where Olvera is freer to be himself, truer to his food memories. New York, in a weird way, brings Olvera closest to Mexico City. On a Monday morning, just after 10, not a lot is happening at Mercado San Cosme. Olvera’s grandfather lived six blocks away, in Colonia San Rafael, and little-kid Enrique hung out here.</p>

          <p>It’s a market off the tourist circuit—stalls sell clothes and shiny pink backpacks for kids, plastic colanders and socks, piñatas like spiky Bethlehem stars at every stage of construction. In the illusory green light of fluorescent tubes, Olvera ambles down one of the lanes toward the skylit center, and the still-quiet, not-yet-open comida corrida booths, home to Mexico City’s cheap midday meals. He points out sapotes negros—rich, chocolate-colored cousins of the persimmon—and a cardboard box of black-spotted bananas, each no bigger than a baby’s foot. “Fruit in Mexico is always overripe,” he says, holding up a hand of decaying bananas, signaling to the girl that he wants to buy. “It’s the taste of moles,</p>
          <p>the smell of chiles that have been drying out. People will drop the peel from an orange on the ground, and it stays there to rot. It’s in the air.” The past keeps its hold on Mexico, even what you breathe.</p>
          <p>Olvera has delivered this discourse on rotten bananas in other interviews. As a boy, he was forced to eat them by his grandmother on his mom’s side, who lived in Tabasco, in Mexico’s far south. “I always thought we were poor, so we had to eat them,” he says. “But we weren’t that poor. As I grew up I understood she liked the flavor.”wrinkles. He orders us each a taco—chicharrón in salsa roja. Pale, semitranslucent sheets of pork skin tinted deep orange overlap one another on a tortilla laid out on a wax paper square. The chicharrón’s edges are gnarled, phantom crispness turning soft to frame a lush texture</p>
